# üè¶ Eternal Fund

The Eternal Fund is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) acting as the governing body of Eternal. This DAO is charged with **three main functions:**

### 1. Allocation of Eternal Treasury Reserves

The Eternal Fund controls the Eternal Treasury, which holds all currency reserves earned through the numerous income streams of the Eternal ecosystem. The fund is tasked with allocating these reserves as it sees fit, always adhering to the goal of further contributing to the [maximization of ETRNL's economic value.](../token/tokenomics/#5.-allocation-of-reserves)

### 2. Maintenance of Eternal Parameters

All Eternal modules rely on multiple parameters related to the ecosystem's mechanics. This includes rates, constants, factors and limiting variables, used in the functionality of gages and ETRNL. The fund is in charge of updating and maintaining these parameters in an effort of promoting the well-being and fluidity of the system.

### 3. Evolution of Eternal

The best systems always adapt to new conditions. In a similar spirit, the Eternal Fund is capable of the addition, removal and manipulation of functionality in all Eternal modules so as to update the Eternal ecosystem. This follows the objective of ensuring evolution of the system and preventing its stagnation.&#x20;
