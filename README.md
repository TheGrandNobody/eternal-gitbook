# ðŸ“” Introduction/FAQ

## What is Eternal?

Eternal is the world's first long-termist decentralized gaging platform, **aiming to popularize a new class of long-term financial instruments, gages, as a solution to a $1.7 trillion problem named short-termism.**

More than that, Eternal is an attempt at demonstrating the significant advantages of neo-long-termist strategies. We begin doing so by **giving you the opportunity to provide liquidity on our platform at a 50% discount as well as being paid for it, simultaneously, whilst remaining economically sustainable**.&#x20;

## What is short-termism?

Short-termism is **the habit of focusing on short-term results at the cost of long-term gain**. For instance, take an individual trying to earn money as fast as possible, paying no attention to risk, or another who only eats takeaway, ignoring their health.&#x20;

**Sounds familiar? We've all been there.**&#x20;

Whether it is the money-hungry corporations with no care for the world, investors aping on risky meme tokens, or mercenary liquidity providers, [we are all psychologically engineered to be short-termist](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.89.1.103).

Most of the time, **the majority of us are making decisions which only benefit us in the moment and end up hurting us or others later on.**

## **Why should I care about short-termism?**

Short termism is everywhere. We breathe short-termism, we make and use short-termist technology and we think and act short-term. Here are **two of the most relevant centralized and decentralized examples of short-termism:**

**The **<mark style="color:red;">**Firm-Investor**</mark>** Dilemma:**

Firms rely on investors to buy and hold their shares. Investors want to make money as fast as possible, and will consequently tend to choose firms which make the most short-term profits. In turn, firms do everything in their power to increase short-term revenue and end up making all kinds of poor decisions with no regard for their long-term consequences. This leads to more issues like unemployment, pollution, less R\&D and ironically, less revenue and growth for the firm.

**The **<mark style="color:red;">**Liquidity-Provider**</mark>** Dilemma:**

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) and blockchain projects rely on liquidity providers in order for tokens to be traded at any given price level on DEXs. Liquidity providers want to earn as much money as possible, and therefore will only provide liquidity in the very short-term (<15 days), whilst the pool rewards are still relatively high, before moving to another project. In turn, projects attempt to appeal to liquidity providers by offering high yields, making all kinds of poor decisions with no regard for their long-term consequences. This leads to more issues such as abnormally high inflation rates, inadequate reflection of value by the token, longer downtrends and periods of recovery and radical short-termist culture.

**There is a short-termist issue in almost every single industry and it is reflecting in the global issues we are currently witnessing with our economies, health systems, environment...**

You name it.

## What is a gage?

A gage is broadly defined as a **contract between two or more stakeholders who promise to pay a given percentage of a deposited asset to the last stakeholder who breaks a predetermined condition.** It is a lot easier to understand a gage through its applications: you may do so by reading [the gage section](products-services/gages/), or the academic whitepaper, _Introduction to gages_.

## Why should I use gages?

The developed gage-related applications, are not only designed and proven to **earn you more money with less risk than any other instrument**, they are also **completely free**, **accessible to all** and **can significantly help change our short-termist behaviour**. The catch? You will need to fight your short-termist instincts, and approach everything with a long-term mentality. This simply means that **the most patient investors will win the most money**.

**Are you more patient than everyone else?**
{% endhint %}

## How do gages solve short-termism?

**Short-termism arises as a result of poor dynamics between individuals.** For example, back to our firm-investor dilemma, one of the main reasons firms are short-termist is because of their unhealthy relationships with investors, who are also short-termist. **Gages are particularly useful when it comes to creating win-win relationships between two or more individuals.**

For this specific dilemma we propose a solution with [loyalty gages](products-services/gages/loyalty-gage/).

But that is not the end of it.

**Most gages are a solution to a specific aspect of short-termism; there are already four other solutions to four additional aspects that are just as harmful, only waiting to be announced.**

## Is a loyalty gage the same as a bond?

No, a bond is a loan made by an investor to an entity, usually a firm or government. While bonds may initially sound similar to a loyalty gage in that they are both long-term financial instruments, they are entirely different.&#x20;

1. **Bonds have a fixed period of maturation (vesting period).** **Loyalty gages are completely flexible** **and allow the liquidity providers to withdraw their liquidity whenever they  wish to do so**, penalizing them rather than forcing them into an involuntary choice.
2. **Bonds yield interest over time to the investor. This entails relatively small rewards distributed over time,** as the full value of the interest is distributed by the end of the maturation period.  **Loyalty gages offer the investor a relatively large, instantaneous bonus percentage** **as well as an additional relatively large bonus** if the investor maintains his promise of long-termism.
3. **Bonds do not fix the issue of short-termism in investors.** Forcing a vesting period onto investors does not change their short-termist psychology over time. From a behavioral psychology standpoint, forcing anything onto anyone is an unsustainable way to change them in the long-term. **A loyalty gage promotes long-term culture through the creation of a symbiotic relationship between any given investor and  asset-distributing entity.** No one is forced to do anything, but there are consequences which discourage anyone from acting poorly, and rewards which encourage anyone who acts virtuously.

## What about a gage in general, is it similar to financial instrument X (bonds, warrants, etc)?

No, gages are a different,  much larger class of long-term financial instruments of their own, which are particularly adept in establishing harmonious dynamics between entities.

1. **A gage has an infinity of applications**, which not only overlap the scope of any given traditional financial instrument, but more broadly, pretty much any interaction between any two or more individuals. &#x20;
2. **Gage-related applications are generally superior in fixing a short-termist issue as compared to traditional financial instruments** as they create symbiotic relationships rather than force either individual into a given traditional role.&#x20;
3. **The flexibility of gages always allow more options, more actions, and more fluidity in the interaction between any two or more individuals.** This means that constrains, limits and other barriers to access and usage normally imposed by traditional financial instruments are removed with gages.

## What is the governance like in Eternal?

Eternal is a fully decentralized autonomous organization. However, Eternal is **not a company** and **not owned by anyone except for its token holders.** Even the company Eternal Finance B.V and the architect Nobody, hold no initial stake in Eternal.

## What is the company Eternal Finance B.V for then?

Eternal Finance B.V is necessary for **two reasons:**

**1. Initial Deployment**

Eternal is a self-sustaining structure. Think of this as a constantly spinning water wheel powered by a river's stream. In this case, Eternal is the water-wheel, and its users (you), the river. Thus, for this to work, we need a water-wheel and an initial stream of sufficient size.

Eternal Finance B.V was necessary to obtain the funds which covered not only marketing (initial stream), but also the designers, front-end developer, audits, website, hosting and any other ingredients (water wheel) required for these two basic necessities.

**2. Future Releases**

Unfortunately, we have not reached a point in society where all systems are fully decentralized. Eternal Finance B.V is primarily here to serve as a bridge of trust between the centralized and decentralized. This will be useful for upcoming releases, where some applications are particularly useful to countries where internet access is not as common, or to make necessary agreements with governments.

## Who is Nobody?

nobody.
