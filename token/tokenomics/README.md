# ðŸª™ ETRNL

### <mark style="color:blue;">Definition</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">ETRNL (spelled out "Eternal") is fundamentally, one of the main three forces in the entire long-termist synergetic system contributing to the overall success of Eternal.  Functionally, it is Eternal's governance and utility token, as well as the primary currency of usage on the platform.</mark>&#x20;

## Economic Value

The intrinsic value of ETRNL is generated and guaranteed by seven factors:

### 1. Gaging Fees

For all gages, regardless of centralized or decentralized applications, a small fee is taken on any deposited assets which are not ETRNL. This fee occurs upon withdrawal of the asset from the given gage and is instantly transferred to the Eternal Treasury. This ensures that **ETRNL is backed by a diversified basket of goods, which accrues in both variety and quantity over time.**&#x20;

### 2. Automatic Liquidity Provision

On every transaction with ETRNL, a small fee is computed. **ETRNL provides its own liquidity to decentralized exchanges** using a fraction of this fee. As the **LP-tokens received from this are only accessible by the** [**Eternal Fund**](../../governance/eternal-fund.md)**, this entails the autonomous creation and maintenance of a price floor for ETRNL.**

### 3/4. Reward Redistribution & Funding (Indefinite Deflation)

One other fraction of the aforementioned ETRNL fee is sent to the [Eternal Fund](../../governance/eternal-fund.md)  and another is redistributed to all holders of ETRNL. As the [Eternal Fund](../../governance/eternal-fund.md) accumulates ETRNL in its treasury, it slowly begins compounding its ETRNL reserves over time. **The total ETRNL supply temporarily deflates as part of it remains unused in the** [**Eternal Fund**](../../governance/eternal-fund.md) **for an indefinite period of time. This percentage of the supply can be re-injected into the economy in the event that ETRNL's rate of deflation becomes detrimentally high.**&#x20;

### **5.** Allocation of Reserves

All of the Eternal Treasury's reserves are to be allocated by the [Eternal Fund](../../governance/eternal-fund.md) to diverse financial strategies, in an effort of maximizing the economic value of said reserves. The strategies which the reserves undergo result in an increase of their value. The quantitative increase in value is also allocated by the [Eternal Fund](../../governance/eternal-fund.md). Hence, the **Eternal Treasury's reserves compound over time, leading to an exponential increase in intrinsic value of ETRNL in the long-term.**&#x20;

### 6/7. Supply burn and Limited Supply (Definite Deflation)

At present, most major currencies in our world's economy are inflationary. This is also true to cryptocurrencies. With such contexts in mind, deflation leads to the increase of purchasing power of a given token. This is further reinforced by the idea that the other currencies against which ETRNL is compared to are inflationary, hence their purchasing power decreases. **ETRNL is deflationary by standard due to having a limited supply**, where no new ETRNL will be printed. Additionally, **ETRNL also burns its supply, which introduces a rate of deflation. This rate is modifiable and can therefore be deactivated in any event of economical distress.**&#x20;
