# Staking

There are two types of staking with ETRNL:

### Passive Staking

ETRNL will automatically reward users with a percentage of all transactions. Users do not have to do anything for this, the token directly updates everyone's balances as transactions occur.

### Active Staking

Users may also stake their tokens on the Eternal platform to indefinitely become a part of the Eternal Fund's treasury. This will reward them with a percentage of all gaging rewards and fees. Passive staking rewards are not earned while active staking.&#x20;
