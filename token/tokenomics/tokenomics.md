# Tokenomics

### Distribution&#x20;

Following Eternal's pledge of being created by the people, for the people, a fair launched [Initial Gage Offering](../../products-services/gages/loyalty-gage/initial-gage-offering.md) will be put in place. Furthermore, in the name of total decentralization of governance, neither the Eternal team or the Eternal B.V owns any initial stake in the system. Instead, both will participate in periodic buy-backs and earn their stake this way.

### Token Allocation

**Maximum/Total Initial Circulating Supply:** 10 billion

* Minimum of 42.5% reserved for a fair Initial Gage Offering (IGO)
* Minimum of 42.5% locked into the Eternal Treasury
* 5% reserved for the pre-seed
* 5% reserved for the seed sale
* 5% reserved for the private sale

**Leftover tokens from the IGO are sent to the Eternal Treasury.**

### Pre-Seed Investors Vesting Schedules

All pre-seed investors who purchased ETRNL, will vest their tokens on the basis of a simple quarterly release schedule. This particular schedule spans over the time period of a year, implying that every three months, 1.25% of the ETRNL supply is unevenly distributed  between 13 individual pre-seed investors for the aforementioned period. In spite of this, **pre-seed investors signed agreements in which at least 50% of any purchased ETRNL must be actively staked in the treasury for an additional year.**

### Seed/Private Investor Vesting Schedules

All seed and private investors who purchased ETRNL, vested their tokens on the basis of the decrease in supply of ETRNL, following the equation:

$$
available\space tokens =vested\space{tokens}\times \frac{initial\space supply - current\space  supply}{initial\space supply}\gamma
$$

**Where** $$\gamma$$ **is equal to 500 for seed investors and 1000 for private investors**, ensuring that these individuals will only have full access to their funds once the total supply has decreased by 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively.

Taking the initial rate of deflation to be 0.5% per transaction, and assuming a minimum constant monthly transaction volume of 100 million ETRNL, this entails a **minimum vesting period of 40 and 20 months**, respectively. In reality, the monthly transaction volume will likely be a lot lower than this optimistic guess. Hence, this aligns with the idea that both seed and private investors believe in ETRNL in the long-term.
