# Standard Gage

### <mark style="color:blue;">Definition</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">A standard gage is the most basic application of a gage, rewarding the last stakeholder to withdraw his deposit.</mark>

### Properties

**Condition:** Non-withdrawal of deposit

**Less** <mark style="color:red;">**Risk**</mark>, **More** <mark style="color:green;">**Reward:**</mark> A standard gage's risk to reward is always equal to $$n-1$$ , where $$n$$ is the number of users (see equation below).

$$R = \frac{\gamma x(n-1)}{\gamma x} = n-1$$

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Example**</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Alice and Bob each own 10000 ETRNL. They enter a standard gage with a deposit of 10000 ETRNL and a risk percentage of 1%. Bob forfeits after three months and has to pay 100 ETRNL to Alice. However, over the period of participation, Bob and Alice's deposits also accumulated 500 ETRNL each. 1% of Bob's rewards are also paid to Alice. Therefore, Alice now owns 10605 ETRNL and Bob, 10395 ETRNL.</mark>
