# Initial Gage Offering

### <mark style="color:blue;">Definition</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">An initial gage offering (IGO) is an initial liquidity offering (ILO) with the option of loyalty gages.</mark>

### **Procedure**

In an **ILO**, individuals deposit a given asset and receive the blockchain project's token in return.&#x20;

In an **IGO**, the procedure remains the same, except individuals are also given the alternative choice of gaining a significant bonus percentage of the amount of tokens they initially want, on the condition they deposit this initial amount to a [loyalty gage](./) between the user and the blockchain project.

In either case, the deposited assets are used to provide liquidity to an asset-token pair on one or more decentralized exchanges.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:blue;">Example</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Alice and Bob are investors taking part in Eternal's IGO. They each own 100 MIM (a stablecoin). Both investors are given the choice of either depositing their 100 MIM on the IGO contract in exchange for 150 ETRNL, or to deposit their 100 MIM on a loyalty gage with a 36% receiver risk percentage and 35% distributor risk percentage .</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Alice chooses the first option,**</mark> <mark style="color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:purple;">depositing 100 MIM and gaining 150 ETRNL.</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">**Bob chooses the second option**</mark><mark style="color:purple;">, depositing 100 MIM and entering a loyalty gage contract with a deposit of 150 ETRNL, receiver risk of 36% and distributor risk  of 35%. The gage's percent condition rewards Bob as soon as the ETRNL token supply has decreased by 0.0015%.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">Bob instantly gains 52.5 ETRNL, available for usage as soon as the 100 MIM are deposited. 150 ETRNL are held by the loyalty gage, available for withdrawal at any time. If the 150 are withdrawn before the percent condition is met, the gage closes in favor of the Eternal Treasury, and Bob pays 54 ETRNL (from the deposit) to the Eternal Treasury. Otherwise, Bob is rewarded an additional 52.5 ETRNL by the Eternal Treasury.</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">**Both Alice and Bob's 100 MIM are added as reserves to a liquidity pair.**</mark>&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Alice gained 150 ETRNL through the ILO (regular choice).**&#x20;

**Bob either gains 148.4 ETRNL or 255 ETRNL through the IGO (loyalty gage choice).**&#x20;
{% endhint %}
