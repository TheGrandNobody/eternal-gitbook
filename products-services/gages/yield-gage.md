# Yield Gage

### <mark style="color:blue;">Definition</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">A yield gage puts all deposits through yield farming strategies, while still rewarding the last stakeholder to withdraw his deposit.</mark>

### Properties

**Condition:** Non-withdrawal of deposit

**Highest **<mark style="color:orange;">**Earning Potential**</mark>** of all DeFi:** Yield gages not only have [all the benefits of liquid gages](liquid-gage.md#properties), they also combine them with the earning potential of any yield farming strategy. Doing the math, that's the earning potential of a gage, added to that of yield farming and the ETRNL token rewards. Hence, **yield gages offer you the highest earning potential of all DeFi, by a large margin.**

### <mark style="color:blue;">**Example**</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">Alice and Bob each own 10000 ETRNL. They enter a yield gage with a deposit of 10000 ETRNL and a risk percentage of 1%. Bob forfeits after three months and has to pay 100 ETRNL to Alice. However, over the period of participation, Bob and Alice's deposits also accumulated 500 ETRNL each from token rewards, and an additional 1500 ETRNL from yield farming. 1% of Bob's total rewards are also paid to Alice. Therefore, Alice now owns 12120 ETRNL and Bob, 11880 ETRNL.</mark>
