# View your stats

<mark style="color:purple;">The User Info page displays any gage you have joined and any important information about these gages. It is also the control panel for your gages, allowing you to exit them if desired. We will tell you everything about it here:</mark>

## 1. Tabs

There are three clickable tabs: **Active**, **Pending** and **Closed**. Each tab displays gages which fall under the tab's category.&#x20;

1. An **active** gage is one which you have entered and is ongoing.&#x20;
2. A **pending** gage is a gage which you have joined but is awaiting some other factors. For example, your gage needs other stakeholders before it activates.&#x20;
3. A **closed** gage is one which you have exited.&#x20;

## 2. Stats

Each row represents a given gage you have joined. There is a total of six pieces of information available for Active/Pending gages and seven for Closed gages. These include:

1. **Gage Type**: the type of the gage (Liquid, Loyalty, Yield, etc...)
2. **Date of Initiation**: the date upon which the gage was created
3. **Deposit**: the amount of the asset and the symbol of the asset you deposited in the gage
4. **Bonus**: the bonus percentage of this gage
5. **Risk**: the net loss you will incur if this gage closes against you
6. **Condition**: The condition of the gage (in the example above, it is a percent, but conditions are not limited to percentages)
7. **Winner:** The stakeholder whom the gage closed in favor of

## 3. Creating/Exiting gages

Once you have joined a gage, clicking on the 'Gage' or 'Go to platform' buttons will not redirect you to the Gage Selection page, but rather to the User Info page. Do not worry, you can still access this page by clicking the 'New Gage' button.&#x20;

<mark style="color:purple;">On the other hand, exiting gages constitutes a small procedure, which we explain</mark> [here](exit-a-gage.md).
