# Stake your ETRNL

<mark style="color:purple;">Staking your ETRNL allows you to earn a share of all gaging revenue. Note that you will need to own some ETRNL before proceeding. You may do so by either</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">entering a gage</mark>](use-the-platform.md)<mark style="color:purple;">, or</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">buying some ETRNL</mark>](buy-etrnl.md)<mark style="color:purple;">. Once that is done, you may follow these simple steps:</mark>

## 1. Go on the Staking page

Start by navigating to the staking page. You can do so by clicking on the 'Stake' button at the top of the page, on the navigation bar.

## 3. Press Approve
