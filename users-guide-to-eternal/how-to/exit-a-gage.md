# Exit a gage

Exiting a gage is faster and easier than joining one, taking **only two simple steps**:

## 1. Select your gage

Begin by navigating to the User Info page and select an Active or Pending gage by clicking on it. Selected gages change color. You can also unselect them by re-clicking on them.

## 2. Exit your gage

Once selected, the 'Exit Gage' button will appear: press it. Two possible scenarios ensue. Either the gage will close in your favor, or against you. If you are closing a losing gage, then the platform will ask you to confirm your choice.

If for any reason you realize you do not want to lose money, you may press the 'Cancel' option. Otherwise, clicking on 'Exit Anyways' will lead to your wallet asking you to confirm your transaction.

Once confirmed, and the transaction has propagated, the gage will now appear under the **Closed** tab.&#x20;
