## 2. Exit your gage

Once selected, the 'Exit Gage' button will appear: press it. Two possible scenarios ensue: either the gage will close in your favor of you, or against you. If you are closing a losing gage, then the platform will ask you to confirm your choice.

If for any reason you realize you do not want to lose money, you may press the 'Cancel' option. Otherwise, clicking on 'Exit Anyways' will lead to your wallet asking you to confirm your transaction.
