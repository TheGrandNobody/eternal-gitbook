# Governance

## <mark style="color:blue;">Introduction</mark>

<mark style="color:purple;">The EternalFund.sol and Timelock.sol contracts are responsible for the governance of the Eternal smart contracts. These are directly taken from the Compound governance contract suite. Note that the Eternal Fund replaces what should normally be the Governor Bravo contract. Documentation for these two contracts can be found</mark> [here](https://compound.finance/docs/governance).
